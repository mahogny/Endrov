/**
 * Endrov image plane. Can be swapped to disk, lazily read and lazily generated. Images can share data using
 * copy-on-write semantics; copies following this are called shadows.
 * 
 * The user has to ensure exclusive access to memory and that it is in fact in memory before writing to it.
 * Thread-safety should be implemented by locking on the EvImage object. Memory is kept in place if lock()
 * is called prior to writing it. Remember to unlock() it after use or it can never be swapped out.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The damn data representation problem! can have another class, EvImageData, with all possible representations.
 * These are: 
 * * Signed/unsigned 8/16/32bit integer array
 * * float/double array 
 * * AWT image
 * 
 * Bonus feature: Java cannot handle unsigned data! AWT does some low-level interpretation. ways around:
 * * let these go from -127 to 127. Non-standard!
 * * ignore sign. +-* are the same on binary level. / is not and need special code; / is not good for integer images anyway
 * * cut one bit to make it fit
 * 
 * Support for extremely large pictures, how does this affect interface?
 *
